Project: Online Learning Platform  (WIP)

An intermediary-advanced type of project which involves creating an online learning platform where users can register, enroll in courses, access course content, submit assignments, and receive grades. The application will have features like user authentication, role-based access control, course management, and assignment grading. 

Concepts within this application:

- Django framework
- User authentication and authorization
- Database models and relationships
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Templates and frontend development
- File uploads and management
- Role-based access control
- Form handling and validation
- Automated emails
- Pagination (With implementation, it makes my side of sorting out large chunks of data. Like splitting Ugali to share among people)
- RESTful API design
- Testing and debugging
- Deployment
